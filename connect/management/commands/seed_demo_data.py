"""
Seed realistic test data for the QuadConnect data model.

Run with:  python manage.py seed_demo_data

Creates eight verified student profiles, a shared interest catalogue, weekend
availability, four approved campus locations, and nineteen weekly matches
over nine weeks: a summer pilot from mid-July, the first fall weeks, and the
current week's two matches (one proposed, one confirmed). Completed matches
carry check-ins and private feedback, so every relationship in the model is
populated and inspectable in Admin. It also creates the two course staff
accounts the assignments ask for.

Idempotent and deterministic: re-running updates the same rows with the
same values instead of duplicating them, so the committed db.sqlite3 can be
rebuilt exactly.
